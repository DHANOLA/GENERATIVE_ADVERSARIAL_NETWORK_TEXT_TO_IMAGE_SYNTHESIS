# **GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK TEXT TO IMAGE SYNTHESIS**
***GENERATING DISTINCT AND DISTINGUISHABLE IMAGES FROM TEXTUAL DESCRIPTIONS IS A CHALLENGING TASK THAT HAS BEEN TACKLED FROM VARIOUS ANGLES. ONE OF THE OBSTACLES THAT NEED TO BE OVERCOME IS CREATING IMAGES THAT ARE BOTH REALISTIC AND CAPTURE THE MEANING OF THE TEXT. GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS (GANS) HAVE DEMONSTRATED PROMISING OUTCOMES IN IMAGE SYNTHESIS. THE GANS USE AN ADVERSARIAL TRAINING TECHNIQUE THAT EMPLOYS THE MINIMAX ALGORITHM. THIS INVOLVES TRAINING A GENERATIVE MODEL (G) AND A DISCRIMINATIVE MODEL (D) SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH OPPOSING GOALS. G IS TRAINED TO MIMIC THE DATA DISTRIBUTION WHILE D IS TRAINED TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN REAL AND GENERATED DATA. TO GENERATE AN IMAGE, AN INPUT NOISE VECTOR (Z) IS PASSED THROUGH G. SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THE FRAMEWORK HAS ATTRACTED A LOT OF ATTENTION. THIS PROJECT PRESENTS A GAN THAT CAN PRODUCE IMAGES BASED ON A GIVEN TEXTUAL DESCRIPTION. THE INPUT VECTOR OF THE GENERATIVE NETWORK IS MADE UP OF A NOISE VECTOR (Z) AND AN EMBEDDED REPRESENTATION OF THE TEXT DESCRIPTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE DISCRIMINATOR CAN BE MODIFIED TO RECEIVE THE TEXT INFORMATION AS INPUT BEFORE PERFORMING ITS CLASSIFICATION.***
